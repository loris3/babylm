This download includes LM Pretraining data for the 2024 shared task, [The BabyLM Challenge](https://babylm.github.io/). The (unzipped) data is not large, only ~700MB.

## Contents of this download
- `babylm_100M`: 100M-word training set for the *strict* track.
- `babylm_10M`: 10M-word training set for the *strict-small* track.
- `babylm_dev`: Development set for both tracks (10M words)
- `babylm_test`: Test set for both tracks (10M words)

Each directory above contains a single `.txt` file from each of the 6 domains listed below.

## Composition of the data
All datasets are sampled from a mixture of 6 data domains, shown below, along with their respective weights in the distributed dataset.
